# Individual Formative Project - ETL, Python and Visualisation


## Dataset
Dataset was collected from Kaggle containing information of individuals. The data records their medical insurance charges together with their personal features like age, gender and their regional location. Below describes the 7 columns of data recorded for each individual:

**Age** - the data captured is recorded as an integer which reports each individuals age.

**Sex** - the data captured is recorded as an onject which reports each individuals gender - male/female.

**BMI** - the data captured is recorded as an float which reports each individuals body mass index.

**Children** - the data captured is recorded as an integer which reports the number of dependents of each individual.

**Smoker** - the data captured is recorded as an object which reports whether an individual smokes or does not smoke - with the response of yes/no.

**Region** - the data captured is recorded as an object which reports the regional area each individual lives - SE/SW/NW/NE.

**Charges** - the data captured is recorded as a float which reports each individuals cost of their medical insurance.

## Objectives 
**ETL** 

To collect the raw data, clean and save the data for analysing.

**Data Visualisation** 

- Descriptive Statistics: Display basic statistics such as average insurance charges by age, gender, and region.
- Correlation Analysis: Visualise correlations between different attributes and insurance charges.
- Predictive Analysis: Develop and visualise predictive reports for estimating insurance costs.
- Geographic Analysis: Visualise the impact of geographic regions on insurance charges.



## Discovery

From the bar charts I discovered the following:

- There seems to be a correlation between insurance charges and region. The bar chart shows that individuals living in the south east region would have lower insurance charges compared to the other 3 regions.

- The below bar chart shows that smokers have a higher insurance charge compared with non-smokers.
